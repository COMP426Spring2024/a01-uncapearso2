        <h2>Creation Story</h2>
        <p>
            Our Holiest Carbohydrate, the great Flying Spaghetti Monster, created the universe after a night of heavy drinking. In His inebriation, he created all of the flaws and wrongs that we here on Earth know. All evidence of evolution or otherwise undermining His existence was placed there by the Flying Spaghetti Monster himself with His Noodly Appendage. It is a test of our faith! Now the question is - are you ready for the test?
        </p>
        <h2>Rituals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Consumption of Spaghetti on Holy Days</li>
            <li>Consumption of Spaghetti on Non-Holy Days</li>
            <li>Wearing of Colanders</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Afterlife - Heaven</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Beer Volcano</li>
            <li>Stripper Factory</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Stale Beer Volcano</li>
            <li>Dirty Stripper Factory</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Name a better heaven concept, I'll wait.
        </p>
        <h2>Pirates</h2>
        <p>
            Oh, the Divine! Pirates belong where the sun shine is warm and the beer volcanoes are crisp! Our divine pirates, their population kept global warming at bay for many years throughout history. As their population has declined, we have seen nothing but an uptick in the global warming trends. #BringBackPirates. #HookHandsRule.

        <h1>Holy Days</h1>
        <p>
            The biggest plus of being a Pastafarian (other than the grace of Him) is Friday as Holy Day! Every weekend is a 3-day weekend! In addition, observe some of our greatest traditions, such as "Pastover" where we feast on (almost) unholy amounts of pasta, or "Ramendan" where we eat only ramen noodles. And we can't forget International Talk Like a Pirate Day! Regardless of the day, don't forget to sign off your prayers with the wonderful "R'amen"
