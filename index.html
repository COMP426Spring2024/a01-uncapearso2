            <p>
                Want to be enlightened? Please, take a look around and consider joining the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster! While some opponents claim the church is purely a thought experiment or satire, they are mistaken! The Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster is legitimate and backed by hard science. Anything to the contrary is pure coincidence.
